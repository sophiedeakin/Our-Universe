# Introduction

The Space Museum website was created to show my passion for space and for others that do to. I love anything to do with space from astronomy, watching live rocket launches on YouTube, and more. The main goal of this project was to design and build a website that showcases my understanding of the modules and coding languages I have learned so far, the website is mainly built using HTML and CSS. This website is designed for educational purposes only.

The website it made up of 4 sections: 
1. Home 
2. Plan Your Visit
3. Exhibits
4. Sign Up - This will allow visitors to sign  up to newsletters to receive the latest news, offeres, and more.

## Target Audience

The website was built to target young children, families or individuals who love space, want to experience something new, and learn new things.

## Business Goals

The business goals of the website are:
1. Persuade visitors to visit the Space Museum by sharing relevant information about the museum which doesn't contain big words or jargon that will confuse the visitors.
2. Expand educational programming by allowing schools to book a visit where children or young people can learn something new, take part in activities and explore the musuem.
3. Secure funding from sales of tickets and potential partnerships with other companies.
4. Create a database of customers to send newsletters to, this will expand the name of the musuem because customers/visitors will share their visit to friends & family as well as social media.

## User Goals

The user goals of the website are:
1. As a first-time vistior, I want the website to have relevant information about the museum which is easy to understand.
2. As a first-time visitor, I want to know what exhibits are available at the musueum and know the meseum is willing to expand and add more exhibits.
3. As a first-time visitor, I want to know about events or activites that are available or coming soon that is open for families or other visitors.
4. As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to sign up to receive newsletters and special offers.
