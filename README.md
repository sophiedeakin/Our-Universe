## Introduction

The Space Museum website was created to show my passion for space and for others that do to. I love anything to do with space from astronomy, watching live rocket launches on YouTube, and more. The main goal of this project was to design and build a website that showcases my understanding of the modules and coding languages I have learned so far, the website is mainly built using HTML and CSS. This website is designed for educational purposes only.

The website it made up of 4 sections: 
1. Home - This page includes: 
2. Plan Your Visit
3. Exhibits
4. Sign Up
