# Introduction

The Space Museum website was created to show my passion for space and for others that do to. I love anything to do with space from astronomy, watching live rocket launches on YouTube, and more. The main goal of this project was to design and build a website that showcases my understanding of the modules and coding languages I have learned so far, the website is mainly built using HTML and CSS. This website is designed for educational purposes only.

The website it made up of 4 sections: 
1. Home 
2. Plan Your Visit
3. Exhibits
4. Keep In Touch - This will allow visitors to sign  up to newsletters to receive the latest news, offeres, and more.

## Target Audience

The website was built to target young children, families or individuals who love space, want to experience something new, and learn new things.

## Business Goals

The business goals of the website are:
1. Persuade visitors to visit the Space Museum by sharing relevant information about the museum which doesn't contain big words or jargon that will confuse the visitors.
2. Expand educational programming by allowing schools to book a visit where children or young people can learn something new, take part in activities and explore the museum.
3. Secure funding from sales of tickets and potential partnerships with other companies.
4. Create a database of customers to send newsletters to, this will expand the name of the musuem because customers/visitors will share their visit to friends & family as well as social media. When the website is shared with others this will increase the foot traffic to the website and increase sales of tickets.

## User Goals

The user goals of the website are:
1. As a first-time vistior, I want the website to have relevant information about the museum which is easy to understand.
2. As a first-time visitor, I want to know what exhibits are available at the museum and know the meseum is willing to expand and add more exhibits.
3. As a first-time visitor, I want to know about events or activites that are available or coming soon that is open for families or other visitors.
4. As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to sign up to receive newsletters and special offers.

# UX

## Strategy

When thinking of the strategy of the website I considered what is the target audience and what features/technologies the users would want for the website.
 
The Space Museum's target audience are:
- Children
- Families
- Schools
- Young Adults
- Those who have a passion for space

What will the users be looking for:
- Information is clear, consise and relevant to what the museum is displaying.
- Images of some of the artefacts or exhibits that the museum has.
- Easy booking system and receive email confirmations.
- The ability to sign up to a newsletter to receive updates.
- Gain information on upcoming events, opening times and opening days.

The website will be designed to offer visitors what they are looking for as well as an easy navigation bar which allows visitors to move around the webstie comfortably. My main focus when creating the website was to make sure the information I input in to the website is understandable, relevant and consise to the visitors so it doesn't overwhelm them, this could result in visitors leaving the website quickly.

Additionally, when designing the website I wanted to make sure I reach the target audience by building the website to be responsive and accessbile to various devices users may use, this includes, computers (PC), laptops, tablets and mobile phones.

## Scope 

To accomplish the business goals and user goals the features that will be included in this release are:

- Museum logo and navigation bar at the top of each page, this will allow visitors to remember the logo and allow the visitors to naviagte easily to each page.
- A slider that provides visitors with information.
    * The first slide has the museum logo and an image of the musuem in the background.
    * The second slide provides information to visitors about the new exhbit that has opened up.
   * The third slide shows a sneak peak of a new cafe opening soon in the museum.
   * The fourth slide shows a picture of one of the displays in the VR Space Room Exhibit.

- On the home page there is some information about what the museum offers with an image of an artifact the museum has on display.
- Newsletter sign up form

For the next release of the website I am planning to :

- Add an interactive map and directions to the museum by providing information for various transports like car, bus and train.
- Create social media accounts on different sites and add them to the website - in the footer and sign up page.
- Design and build another page for frequently asked questions, payment method types, and cancellations and refunds.
- Design and build a shop page where visitors can browse and purchase merchandise and gift cards.

## Structure 

The website is split into four different pages, I chose to structure the website this way because the website will have a lot of information. I felt it would look cluttered and took in considerations on how the target audience would feel when visiting the website for the first time, the visitors would feel overwhelmed by all the inforamtion and leave the website.

Additonally, I chose to order navigation bar as 'Home > Plan Your Visit > Exhibits > Keep In Touch' because I felt like visitors are able to understand the information on each page. The Exhibits page contains break lines in between each exhibit, I added this detail because I felt the page needed something to break up each description so it didn't look too cluttered and confusing, I also changed the colour of the line breaks to #027c9b which matches the logo and other colours I have used. Finally, the newsletter sign up page has a simple design for visitors to easily sign up to the Space Museum's newsletters.

### Wireframes 

#### Home 

![Home Page Wireframes](https://github.com/sophiedeakin/Space-Museum/blob/main/Wireframes/Home%20Wireframes.png)

#### Plan Your Visit

#### Exhibits

#### Keep In Touch 

![Keep In Touch](https://github.com/sophiedeakin/Space-Museum/blob/main/Wireframes/Keep%20In%20Touch%20Wireframes.png)

The wireframes shown above are the origianl plans and ideas of how I wanted the Space Museum website to look like but with some added changes.

The first change I made whilst building the website was the Space Museum logo. My original idea was to create a simple heading with the name Space Museum but after some thinking I wanted to make the logo look unique and stand out, I decided to be creative and use other resources to create the Space Museum Logo. 

Additionally, the next change I made was the layout on the 'Plan Your Visit' page for the Calendar and Opening Times, my original idea was to have them next each other when users are viewing it their mobile device but as I was building that section I felt like they were too close together and I changed it to where they are vertically align instead of horizontally. 

The Final change I made was to the 'Keep In Touch' page, in my original plan and ideas for sign up to the newsletters I wanted the header to just say 'Sign up to newsletters'. While I was building that section I felt the heading was too short and boring, I decided to change the main heading to 'Find Out First' and added some extra detail under the header which tells the visitors to 'Sign up now to receive newsletters with all the latest updates, special offers, competitions, event details, and more'. by doing this it gives the users an idea of what may be included in the newsletters and what to look out for.  

## Surface

#### *Colours*

The colour palatte I have chosen for this website was based around the main logo of the website, the colours I chose were:

- #000000
- #ffffff

#### *Typography* 

I wanted the website to look clean as much as possible and I decided to only use one font style through out the whole website, the font I chose was 'Roboto' from the Google Fonts website. I have added an image below to give you an idea of what the font looks like.

## Features 

### *Space Museum Logo*

The Space Musuem Logo is situated at the top of the website on every page, the logo was created using Canva. Using Canva's resources I was able to design the logo by picking three different images that I felt was relevant to my project idea and layered them on top of each other. Next I chose the font for the name of the project, I wanted the font to match the theme of the project which is space and the font I chose is 'Cosmic Octo'.

### *Navbar* 

The navbar is responsive and is displayed at the top of every page under the Space Musuem logo. When on an active page the name of that page on the navbar will change the colour to a shade of blue (#027c9b), while the other pages on the navbar will have a off-white colour (#fafafa). When hovering over the navbar the pages backgroud coour will chages to the same shade of blue (#027c9b).

### *Slider*

The slider feature is displayed on all the pages in the website. I wanted the website to have something similar to a slideshow which will autmoatically transition to the slide and provide users with images and important informaiton like a new exhibit. I also used Canva to design the images and text for the slider, the images I used were from Pixabay and Pexels.

The slider has four slides which includes:

1. An images of the Space Museum building and the logo in the bottom left corner.
2. An image of the new exhibit and text in the bottom left corner providing visotrs with information about the new exhibit that has just opened.
3. An image of the cafe that is coming soon.
4. An image of an exhibit display inside the Space Museum.

### *Footer*

The footer feature is display at the bottom of all the pages in the website. When buildign the footer I wanted it to look simple, the footer has a navbar at the top which allows visitors to navigate to each page, and I chose to have the background colour of the footer section to be transparant black.

### *Background Image*

When I first started working the project I went for a solid black background but I felt like it made the website look a bit plain, intead I decided to change the background to an image of space and is visible on all the pages. 

## Features to implement in the future

After gaining some knowledge and understanding of Javascript I want to implement in into the website by improving on the slider that is present on all the pages which provides visitors with images and latest news, I want to make the slider more interactive by adding arrows to either sides of the slider which allows visitors to click on to go through each slide.

Addtionally, once learning and understanding Javascript I also want to upgrade the calendar which allows visitors to go through each month to see what days the museum is open and closed. I also want to change how visitors book their tickets, I have an idea to design and build it where the visitors can choose their tickets as normal, then choose and allocation time slot to arrive, and finally the date they wish to visit the museum.

In addition to the change in the booking I also want to utilise Javascript by adding a popup feature that displays once the visitor click on the 'Book Now' button, the popup will allow the visitor to input their card details and email address to purchase the tickets and once submitted they will receive a confirmation email with their e-ticket attached.

The final feature I would like to implement is designing a map of the musuem which allows visitors to see where each exhibit is located within the museum and add a link which allows visitors to download the map onto their devices.

# Testing 

### User Stories

1. **As a first-time vistior, I want the website to have relevant information about the museum which is easy to understand.**

When you enter the website and scroll down you are able to see information about the musuem. The information is split into two paragraphs, the first paragraph tells visitors the "Space Museum is the perfect family days out." and is "open daily from 10.00am.", and the second paragraph tells visitors why they should visit the Space Museum, "Visit the Space Museum today and explore thrilling exhibits and learn all about space, rockets, and more.".

### Lighthouse 

Lighthouse is a feature in Google Developer Tools which is used for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performane, accessibility, progressive web pages, SEO, and more. When first running Lighthouse I acheived a really low score for perfromance, reference image below:

![Lighthouse First Analysis of website](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=375A740EE4B8380B&id=375A740EE4B8380B%217371&parId=375A740EE4B8380B%213359&o=OneUp)

When looking the at recommendations to improve the performance it recommeneded me to compress PNG and JPEG images to WebP to allow it load faster and less data consumption. The next improvement was Accessibility which is yellow, it recommended me to change the contrast of the "class="active"" in the navbar as it's dark and difficult for many users to read. After applying those recommendations I managed to improve my score, see image below:

![Lighthouse positive results after changes](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=375A740EE4B8380B&id=375A740EE4B8380B%217543&parId=375A740EE4B8380B%213359&o=OneUp)

From the image above I managed to improve the performance and accessibilty. The improvements I made to increase performance were compressing PNG and JPEG images to WebP which allows the image to load faster, the next improvement was decreasing the width of the slider and event image to allow the website to load faster. Finally, I improved the accessibility by changing the contrast of the active page in the navbar to make it easier to read.

### Google Developer Tools 

When testing my website I constantly used Google Developer Tools which allowed me to idenetify any bugs and test the responsiveness when viewing the website on different devices. 

![Google Developer Tools](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=375A740EE4B8380B&id=375A740EE4B8380B%217545&parId=375A740EE4B8380B%213359&o=OneUp)

I wanted to used different types of devices when testing the responsiveness from Android, iOS, tablets and desktop. The devcies I used were:
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- iPhone XR
- Surface Duo
- Surface Pro 7
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- iPad
- iPad Pro
- Nest Hub
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- Desktop

### Known bugs and fixes

While testing the webiste I wanted to make sure any clickable features are working and open in a new page. The first bug I found was when clicking on the "Book Now" button it comes up with an error, see image below of error.

1[405 Not Allowed Error](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=375A740EE4B8380B&id=375A740EE4B8380B%217549&parId=375A740EE4B8380B%213359&o=OneUp)

While using Google Developer Tools I found the bug was I didn't specify the correct way to send the form-data, my original code was "method="POST" this was causing the 405 error when clicking on "Book Now" button. To fix the error I changed POST to GET and now the page opens correctly. See image below the fixed issue and correct page.

![Error fixed and book now page is displayed](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=375A740EE4B8380B&id=375A740EE4B8380B%217561&parId=375A740EE4B8380B%213359&o=OneUp)

The next bug I found after fixing the "Book Now" button is when I was directed to the new page the navbar was displaying the wrong page and was causing an error. The navbar showed the "Sign Up" page instead of "Keep In Touch" and when clicking on that page it will display this error:

![404 error](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=375A740EE4B8380B&id=375A740EE4B8380B%217563&parId=375A740EE4B8380B%213359&o=OneUp)

After going through all the html files I realised where the error was coming from. When I decided to change the name of the "signup.html" to "keepintouch.html" in the navbar I forgot to change it in the book now page. Once I made that change the error was fixed the navbar was displaying the correct page and I can navigate to it.

![404 error fixed and navbar showing Keep In Touch](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=375A740EE4B8380B&id=375A740EE4B8380B%217569&parId=375A740EE4B8380B%213359&o=OneUp)
