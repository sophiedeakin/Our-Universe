# Introduction

The Space Museum website was created to show my passion for space and for others that do to. I love anything to do with space from astronomy, watching live rocket launches on YouTube, and more. The main goal of this project was to design and build a website that showcases my understanding of the modules and coding languages I have learned so far, the website is mainly built using HTML and CSS. This website is designed for educational purposes only.

The website it made up of 4 sections: 
1. Home 
2. Plan Your Visit
3. Exhibits
4. Sign Up - This will allow visitors to sign  up to newsletters to receive the latest news, offeres, and more.

## Target Audience

The website was built to target young children, families or individuals who love space, want to experience something new, and learn new things.

## Business Goals

The business goals of the website are:
1. Persuade visitors to visit the Space Museum by sharing relevant information about the museum which doesn't contain big words or jargon that will confuse the visitors.
2. Expand educational programming by allowing schools to book a visit where children or young people can learn something new, take part in activities and explore the musuem.
3. Secure funding from sales of tickets and potential partnerships with other companies.
4. Create a database of customers to send newsletters to, this will expand the name of the musuem because customers/visitors will share their visit to friends & family as well as social media. When the website is shared with others this will increase the foot traffic to the website and increase sales of tickets.

## User Goals

The user goals of the website are:
1. As a first-time vistior, I want the website to have relevant information about the museum which is easy to understand.
2. As a first-time visitor, I want to know what exhibits are available at the musueum and know the meseum is willing to expand and add more exhibits.
3. As a first-time visitor, I want to know about events or activites that are available or coming soon that is open for families or other visitors.
4. As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to sign up to receive newsletters and special offers.

# UX

## Strategy

When thinking of the strategy of the website I considered what is the target audience and what features/technologies the users would want for the website.
 
The Space Museum's target audience are:
- Children
- Families
- Schools
- Young Adults
- Those who have a passion for space

What will the users be looking for:
- Information is clear, consise and relevant to what the museum is displaying.
- Images of some of the artifacts or exhibits that the museum has.
- Easy booking system and receive email confirmations.
- The ability to sign up to a newsletter to receive updates.
- Gain information on upcoming events, opening times and opening days.

The website will be designed to offer visitors what they are looking for as well as an easy navigation bar which allows visitors to move around the webstie comfortably. My main focus when creating the website was to make sure the information I input in to the website is understandable, relevant and consise to the visitors so it doesn't overwhelm them, this could result in visitors leaving the website quickly.

Additionally, when designing the website I wanted to make sure I reach the target audience by building the website to be responsive and accessbile to various devices users may use, this includes, computers (PC), laptops, tablets and mobile phones.

## Scope 

To accomplish the business goals and user goals the features that will be included in this release are:

- Museum logo and navigation bar at the top of each page, this will allow visitors to remember the logo and allow the visitors to naviagte easily to each page.
- A slider that provides visitors with information.
    * The first slide has the museum logo and an image of the musuem in the background.
    * The second slide provides information to visitors about the new exhbit that has opened up.
   * The third slide shows a sneak peak of a new cafe opening soon in the museum.
   * The fourth slide shows a picture of one of the displays in the VR Space Room Exhibit.

- On the home page there is some information about what the museum offers with an image of an artifact the museum has on display.
- Newsletter sign up form

For the next release of the website I am planning to :

- Add an interactive map and directions to the museum by providing information for various transports like car, bus and train.
- Create social media accounts on different sites and add them to the website - in the footer and sign up page.
- Design and build another page for frequently asked questions, payment method types, and cancellations and refunds.
- Design and build a shop page where visitors can browse and purchase merchandise and gift cards.

## Structure 

The website is split into four different pages, I chose to structure the website this way because the website will have a lot of information. I felt it would look cluttered and took in considerations on how the target audience would feel when visiting the website for the first time, the visitors would feel overwhelmed by all the inforamtion and leave the website.

Additonally, I chose to order navigation bar as 'Home > Plan Your Visit > Exhibits > Sign Up because I felt like visitors are able to understand the information on each page. The Exhibits page contains break lines in between each exhibit, I added this detail because I felt the page needed something to break up each description so it didn't look too cluttered and confusing, I also changed the colour of the line breaks to # (add in hex code of colour).
